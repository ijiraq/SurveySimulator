#
# For Megaprime, the 36 CCDs are 2048x4612 with pixels 0.18689x0.18689", so
# assuming a total footprint of 1 sq.deg, the filling factor is 0.9164
#
# 2015A-P block
#
# This is the first block for which the mosaic includes the ears, making the
# total surface larger than 1 sq.deg. 
# From reading the plate solution of a several images, JMP defined the
# footprint of the camera. It's given in create_ears() in SurveySubs.f.
# From this footprint, we compute the total area covered 0.99443x0.97918 +
# 0.47773x0.21921 = 0.97373 + 0.10473 = 1.0785 sq.deg.
#
# From the plate solutions, the pixel size is 0.186"x0.1849". So the area
# covered by CCD for each chip is 0.025065 sq.deg., or 1.0026 sq.deg. for the
# full camera. Hence the filling factor is 0.9297
#
# According to the vtags, number of files and notes on the block blinking wiki,
# 2 out of 800 chips failed, so effective area is 
# 798/800 = 0.9975 = 99.75% of the total area, so filling factor becomes
# 0.99875*0.9297 = 0.9274.
#
# Now, there is a chance there is some overlap between the different frames.
# Actually, it's a known fact as some object(s) got observed twice in the
# discovery run. The overlap is measured using SurfArea.f.
# From counting how many objects are found in multiple pointings, we get the
# effective area as:
# Effective area / Assumed area = 1./(1. + float(n_track-hist(1))/float(n_track)).
# Here, n_track = 1000000 and hist(1) = 994446 so the factor is 1./1.005554
# So the filling factor is 0.9975*0.9297/1.005554 = 0.9223.
#
# This final filling factor is all good if we use the footprint of the 40 CCDs
# with ears. If we use some other polygon, we must first compute the area of
# the said polygon, S_p, and then compare it to the actual effective area of
# all pixels, Sccd x num_ccd x overlap_factor = 0.025065*798/1.005554 = 19.89139
# sq.deg.
#
# In the following, the total surface area is 2*2.721979*(2.983277+0.994426)
# = 21.6544 sq.deg. So the final filling factor is effective area / total
# surface area = 19.89139/21.6544 = 0.9186
